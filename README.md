## Description
The Kings Solar Calculator is a web application designed to assist users in determining their solar energy needs. By entering monthly consumption data, the calculator provides an average monthly consumption, average daily consumption, the system size in KW, and the number of solar modules required.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Input Fields**:
    - The application dynamically generates input fields for 13 months, allowing users to specify their energy consumption for each month.

2. **Solar Module Wattage Input**:
    - Users can specify the wattage of the solar modules they are considering, which influences the calculation of the number of modules needed.

3. **Results Display**:
    - Once the monthly data and module wattage are entered, the user can click "Calculate" to see:
        - Average monthly consumption.
        - Average daily consumption.
        - System size in KW.
        - Number of solar modules required.
        - Individual monthly consumption values.

4. **Visualization**:
    - The application provides two types of charts, a bar chart and a line graph, visualizing the monthly consumption values.

## How to Use

1. Open `KingsCalc.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter your monthly consumption data for each of the 13 months.
3. Provide the solar module wattage.
4. Click on the "Calculate" button.
5. View your results and the visualized data on the bar chart and line graph.

## Technical Details

The calculator is powered by JavaScript, with data visualization supported by the [Chart.js library](https://www.chartjs.org/). The application's layout and styling are implemented using CSS.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with other solar efficiency tools.
- Provide additional data visualizations.
- Offer module comparisons based on entered wattage.
